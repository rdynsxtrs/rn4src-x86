# GCC 4.7.2

**Note:** 

1. In addition to copying the `debian` folder, the file `java-class-files.tar.xz.uue`
needs to be copied over to the root directory where the sources were unpacked.

2. It is **not possible** to build GCC 4.7.2 with itself! So once you installed gcc 4.7
you cannout build the sources again easily
